## Dappy, The Baron Dapper Skeleton

```markdown
Dappy comes from the race of Shadow People. He has taken on the form of a bone-like structure, in the shape
of a skeletal humanoid figure. He is quite tall, and very slender, of course. He sports his signature 
dapper look, with a suit and top hat. Though he looks fancy, he is actually quite unwealthy and comes from
generations of poverty. He has some mental disorders, including but not limited to: Schizophrenia,
Megalomania, and Bipolar. He looks for friends where there are none, and is always happy to meet new people.
